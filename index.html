      <h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3>
      <p>"In Ford's debut novel, a depressed, slovenly man becomes an unlikely hero for mankind by bringing a message direct from God. Ford crafts some genuinely funny, strange, and sad moments in this novel... there are some inspired moments of lunacy. [Miracle Man] is an underdog story with wild, inventive craftsmanship."</p>

      <h3>Sometimes life becomes so unbearable,</h3>
      <p>it's time to throw in the towel.
        Tom Hranicky certainly thought so. Chronically unemployed, dumped by his wife and stuck in a dead-end trailer park with nothing but a three-legged dog for company, Tom decides it's time to take the Big Dirt Nap.
        But when he ties sixty weather balloons to a La-Z-Boy recliner to make his grand exit, something unexpected happens. He floats into heaven. Where he finds out he still has one champion in his corner: God Himself. Or Herself, as in Oprah, which is how God appears to Tom.
        God talks a reluctant Tom into returning to earth as God's envoy, to deliver a simple one-word message to the world. But it soon becomes painfully apparent that Tom might not be the man for the job.
        MIRACLE MAN is the story about a different kind of faith. The faith to believe in yourself once again, long after everyone else has stopped.</p>

      <h2>Five-star reviews on Amazon:</h2>
      <p>"You know you've read a good book when you don't want it to end. This bizarre tale made me laugh out loud, cry, and root for the           title character."
        "An insightful look at media madness, our culture of celebrity and the hurt we inflict on each other. I cheered for Tom's survival every step of the way."
        "Every one of us is a miracle and our life is a gift... Bill Ford's honest and humorous words tell the tale without being preachy, religious or corny. Smiling still."</p>
