      <h1>He went for a ride in a La-Z-Boy recliner and landed on God's doorstep.</h1>
      <h1><i>Miracle Man: A Novel</i></h1>
      <h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3>
      <p>"In Ford's debut novel, a depressed, slovenly man becomes an unlikely hero for mankind by bringing a message direct from God. Ford crafts some genuinely funny, strange, and sad moments in this novel... there are some inspired moments of lunacy. [Miracle Man] is an underdog story with wild, inventive craftsmanship."</p>

      <h3>Sometimes life becomes so unbearable,</h3>
      <p>it's time to throw in the towel.
        Tom Hranicky certainly thought so. Chronically unemployed, dumped by his wife and stuck in a dead-end trailer park with nothing but a three-legged dog for company, Tom decides it's time to take the Big Dirt Nap.
        But when he ties sixty weather balloons to a La-Z-Boy recliner to make his grand exit, something unexpected happens. He floats into heaven. Where he finds out he still has one champion in his corner: God Himself. Or Herself, as in Oprah, which is how God appears to Tom.
        God talks a reluctant Tom into returning to earth as God's envoy, to deliver a simple one-word message to the world. But it soon becomes painfully apparent that Tom might not be the man for the job.
        MIRACLE MAN is the story about a different kind of faith. The faith to believe in yourself once again, long after everyone else has stopped.</p>
